/**
 * The <code>Aircraft</code> class provides facilities for modelling a commercial jet 
 * aircraft with multiple travel classes. New aircraft types are created by explicitly 
 * extending this class and providing the necessary configuration information. 
 * 
 * In particular, <code>Aircraft</code> maintains a collection of currently booked passengers, 
 * those with a Confirmed seat on the flight. Queueing and Refused bookings are handled by the 
 * main {@link asgn2Simulators.Simulator} class. 
 *   
 * The class maintains a variety of constraints on passengers, bookings and movement 
 * between travel classes, and relies heavily on the asgn2Passengers hierarchy. Reports are 
 * also provided for logging and graphical display.
